The previous AI engineer effectively initiated the ALSABQON mobile app, utilizing Expo/React Native for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend. Initial efforts focused on core features like animated week transitions, haptic feedback, and the  component. Significant work was done on the My Prayers and Tasks pages, adding visual enhancements and complex interactions. The trajectory detailed the systematic development of a new Lessons page, including data structures and navigation.

During this phase, the engineer encountered and resolved critical issues related to Expo Router TypeScript errors and mobile preview problems, leveraging the  and implementing solutions like serving a production build. Following this, new critical bugs were reported by the user, including missing prayer icons, broken Quran search, and UI/logic issues with prayer recording and progress bars. The AI successfully addressed the missing prayer icons by downloading user-provided SVGs, converting them to base64, and integrating them into the app. The trajectory concludes with the AI beginning to investigate the prayer progress bar and recording issues.

<product_requirements>
The ALSABQON application is a cross-platform prayer tracker and Qur’an study tool, implemented with Expo/React Native and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Initial features include authentication, user profiles, a Home screen with drawer navigation, and a story feed. The My Prayers module features a 7-day progress bar, an expandable Hijri/Gregorian calendar, and a list of five prayers with a record button. The Record view allows Qur'an verse selection (full surah/range), searching, and answering questions per rak'ah for scoring, which generate tasks.

Recent enhancements:
-   Animated week transitions, haptic feedback, and action sheet on .
-   Conditional visibility of the 7-day week bar.
-   My Prayers page: Prayer icons, task progress bars, clickable prayer rows, Daily Progress bar.
-   Tasks page: Prayer icons, progress indicators, grouping by date/prayer/type, swipe actions, categories/priorities.
-   Lessons page: Islamic Learning Management System with categories (Fiqh, Aqeedah, Tafseer), overall knowledge progress, expandable lessons, lesson content (text/video), 1-5 star rating, engagement questions (understand, dua, practice, share/teach), completion progress bar, comments section.
-   Settings page: Font size, notifications, theme selection, language preferences, share app, prayer calculation methods (5 specific ones: Muslim World League, ISNA, Egyptian General Authority, Umm Al-Qura, Karachi), Asr calculation (Hanafi, Shafi/Maliki/Hanbali), daily data backup/restore.

**Key Files and Directories:**
-   : Defines the main drawer navigation. It was modified to correctly include the  directory as a navigable route after initial routing issues.
-   : (Refactored from ) The main Lessons screen, responsible for displaying lesson categories and navigating to individual lessons.
-   : (Refactored from ) The Lesson Detail screen, displaying content for a specific lesson based on ID, with UI for rating and engagement.
-   : Newly created to define data structures (, , ) and persistence logic for the Lessons page using .
-   : Newly created to implement the comprehensive Settings UI, including various user preferences like theme, language, and prayer calculation methods.
-   : Newly created to manage data persistence for the application settings using .
-   : Modified to add  and  colors, resolving TypeScript errors.
-   : Critical for displaying prayer icons. It was updated to integrate user-provided base64 encoded SVG data for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.
-   : Main My Prayers screen. Modified to fix an import statement for settings functions ( to ).
-   : The prayer recording screen. This file contains the logic for Quran search and السورة كاملة features, which are currently reported as non-functional and require debugging.
-   : Contains the SQLite implementation for local Quran data access and search. This is the underlying source of the Quran search functionality currently not working.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Debug and fix Quran search functionality in the prayer record screen.
-   Debug and fix السورة كاملة (Complete Surah) functionality in the prayer record screen.
-   Fix Prayer Progress Bar being stuck in red and displaying data mismatches.
-   Ensure recording a prayer for a previous day updates the main menu and hides the record button.
-   Move language buttons (AR, AR+EN, AR+ES) to the right of السورة كامله in the prayer record screen.
-   Fix Prayer Page UI Layout: enable scrolling, ensure all tasks are visible, and add a bottom border to prevent button overlap.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was systematically addressing a list of critical issues reported by the user. The most recently completed task was fixing the Missing SVG Logos problem. The user had provided five new SVG files for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers. The AI successfully downloaded each SVG, converted them into base64 encoded strings, and then updated the  file with these new, correct base64 values. This resolved the visual bug where prayer icons were not appearing in the application.

Following the successful integration of the prayer icons, the AI engineer is now transitioning to the next reported critical issue: the Prayer Progress Bar Stuck in Red and related Record Button Issues. This involves investigating why the progress bar for prayers is not accurately reflecting progress beyond 50%, why there's a data mismatch when opening a prayer, and why recording a prayer for a previous day doesn't update the main menu UI, keeping the record button visible. The AI has stated its intent to check the prayer record and progress logic next.

Additionally, the application environment experienced persistent mobile preview issues (file watcher limits, ngrok tunnel conflicts), which the AI temporarily bypassed by creating and serving a production build on . This allows for previewing the app's current state, including the newly implemented Lessons and Settings pages, but the underlying development server start-up issues are not fully resolved.
