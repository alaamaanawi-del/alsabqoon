The previous AI engineer meticulously addressed a series of critical feature enhancements and bug fixes for the ALSABQON mobile application. The trajectory began with the AI engineer summarizing prior work, including debugging frontend  issues, restoring and redesigning the My Charities page, and resolving persistent timestamp inaccuracies by standardizing client-side timestamp generation and display logic in  functions across Azkar and Charity sections.

Subsequently, the engineer tackled several new user requests: implementing robust date range filtering for both My Azkar and My Charities pages, ensuring real-time data synchronization. A significant feature added was the الدعوة – تعليم (Da'wah - Teaching) category, integrated with the prayer recording flow, allowing automatic entry creation with comments. Extensive work was dedicated to overhauling the prayer page's Quran search and verse selection, culminating in a  for non-overlapping results, a  for precise verse navigation with highlighting, and a Tafseer display. The final tasks involved refining search behavior, Rakka workflow, and conditional display of teaching fields, with one navigation fix remaining incomplete.

<product_requirements>
The ALSABQON app, a prayer tracker, requires extensive enhancements for My Prayers, My Azkar, and My Charities.
**My Prayers**:
*   **Search/Sura Selection**: Search box must display all verses matching input, with live updates and no 100-limit. Results: Verse text + Sura name (Arabic/English) + Verse number, scrollable. Clicking a verse opens the SuraViewer at that verse, highlighted. السورة كاملة button next to search bar opens SuraViewer for whole sura or range selection. Selected verses save to rakka menu and display in an expandable, scrollable 8-line box. Search results must appear in a separate popup/full-page modal and hide after selection. Removed unused عربي / تفسير buttons.
*   **Workflow Navigation**: After تم on Rakka 1, navigate to Rakka 2. After تم on Rakka 2, return to the prayer list for the same date.
*   **Teaching Count Field**: كم شخص علمت؟ field (with an expandable أضف ملاحظات comment box) appears only if Question #4 (هل علمت الايات؟) is answered Yes.
*   **Tafseer Feature**: Add a تفسير button to the selected verses box to display verses with translation/tafseer.
**My Azkar**:
*   **Filtering**: Implement filter buttons (أسبوع / شهر / اليوم / custom range) to dynamically update data on the main Azkar list page, with backend queries applying correct date ranges.
*   **New Category: الدعوة – تعليم**: Record teaching activities (number of people taught, notes/context). Integrated with My Prayers: Answering Q4 with a count automatically creates an entry with an auto-generated comment.
**My Charities**:
*   **Filtering**: Implement filter buttons (أسبوع / شهر / اليوم / custom range) to dynamically update data on the main list page, with backend queries applying correct date ranges.
*   **Data Synchronization**: Main page list must auto-refresh after adding charities. Filter switching must correctly show data; the Today filter should not show 0 entries. Optimize data fetching.
**Global Timestamping**: All entries (Azkar/Charities) must record/display exact local device time, handling time zones and midnight rollovers correctly for filtering boundaries.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving the remaining issues in the prayer page, as outlined in the user's message (Chat Message 415). The specific tasks included: ensuring search results open the full sura at the exact verse, removing artificial limits on selected verse counts, making the كم شخص علمت؟ field conditional with an expandable comment option, and fixing the Rakka workflow navigation.

The AI engineer successfully completed the following:
*   **Search Result Navigation**: Modified  to load the complete sura and implemented scroll-to-verse functionality, ensuring the sura opens directly at the selected verse.
*   **Selected Verses Limit**: Verified that  already uses  for counting, thus there is no artificial limit to the displayed number of selected verses.
*   **Conditional كم شخص علمت؟ field**: Implemented logic in  to make the teaching count field conditional on the user answering Yes to Question #4, and added an expandable comment input field for additional notes.

The Workflow Navigation fix (Rakka 1 -> Rakka 2 -> Prayer List) was started but remains incomplete.
