The provided trajectory documents the work of an AI engineer on the ALSABQON mobile application, transitioning from initial build-out to critical bug fixes. After receiving the codebase, the AI confirmed the plan with the user. The initial task involved inspecting relevant files (, , , , Quran DB files), navigating challenges with bash syntax for file paths.

The core of the work focused on resolving critical UI and logic issues. The AI successfully implemented dynamic coloring for the , removing a hardcoded red state. Significant modifications were made to the prayer  screen, including adding a  for Quran search results, enabling screen scrollability, and correctly positioning language selection buttons. An import error in  was also rectified. Facing frontend preview issues due to ngrok, the AI efficiently bypassed this by building and serving a production web build locally. Final verification through screenshots confirmed the successful implementation of prayer icons, dynamic progress bars, and a fully functional, well-laid-out record screen. The trajectory concludes with a comprehensive summary of the app's current state and resolved issues.

<product_requirements>
The ALSABQON application is a cross-platform mobile prayer tracker and Qur’an study tool, built using Expo/React Native for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend. It features user authentication, profiles, a Home screen with drawer navigation, and a story feed. The My Prayers module includes a 7-day progress bar, expandable Hijri/Gregorian calendar, and prayer recording capabilities. The Record view allows Qur'an verse selection (full surah/range), searching, and answering questions per rak'ah for scoring.

Recent enhancements and existing features include: animated week transitions and haptic feedback on ; prayer icons, task progress bars, and a daily progress bar on My Prayers; prayer icons, progress indicators, and grouping on Tasks. A Lessons page provides an Islamic Learning Management System with categories (Fiqh, Aqeedah, Tafseer), overall knowledge progress, lesson content, 1-5 star ratings, engagement questions (understand, dua, practice, share/teach), completion progress, and comments. A Settings page offers comprehensive user preferences: font size, notifications, theme selection, language preferences, app sharing, and configurable prayer calculation methods (Muslim World League, ISNA, Egyptian, Umm Al-Qura, Karachi) and Asr calculation (Hanafi, Shafi/Maliki/Hanbali), along with daily data backup/restore. The application also supports full Right-to-Left (RTL) layout for Arabic, optimized for mobile-first user experience.

**Key Files and Directories:**
-   : Defines the main drawer navigation, ensuring all top-level routes are accessible.
-   : The primary Lessons screen.
-   : Detail screen for individual lessons.
-   : Manages data structures and persistence for the Lessons page.
-   : Implements the comprehensive Settings UI.
-   : Manages data persistence for application settings.
-   : Defines the color palette for the application.  and  colors were previously added.
-   : Critical for displaying prayer icons. It was updated *prior to this trajectory* to integrate base64 encoded SVG data for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.
-   : Main My Prayers screen.
    -   Summary: Displays prayer progress, calendar navigation, and entries for individual prayers.
    -   Changes: Corrected an import statement, changing  to  to ensure proper access to settings-related functions.
-   : The prayer recording screen.
    -   Summary: This file handles the user interface and logic for recording prayers, including Quran verse selection, search, and engagement questions.
    -   Changes: Significantly modified to enhance UI/UX. Changes include wrapping the main content in a  for full scrollability, integrating a  component to display Quran search results, repositioning the language selection buttons (عربي, عربي + English, عربي + Español) to the right of the السورة كاملة button, and adding/updating styles (e.g., ) for improved layout and responsiveness.
-   : Manages the local persistence of prayer records using . No direct changes were made in this trajectory, but it is a core data management file.
-   : Component used to render visual progress bars for prayers and tasks.
    -   Summary: Displays a progress bar with a percentage value.
    -   Changes: Modified to implement a dynamic color system (green, orange, yellow, red) based on the progress percentage, replacing a previous hardcoded red color for better visual feedback.
-   : Contains the SQLite database implementation for local Quran data access and search functionality on native platforms. No direct changes were made in this trajectory, but its functionality is crucial for the Quran search feature.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved several critical user-reported issues. The Missing SVG Logos bug was previously addressed by updating  with base64 encoded SVG data for all five daily prayers.

This trajectory focused on:
1.  **Prayer Progress Bar**: The Prayer Progress Bar Stuck in Red issue was fixed by modifying . The component now dynamically colors the progress bar based on completion percentage: green (75%+), orange (50-74%), yellow (25-49%), and red (<25%), providing accurate visual feedback.
2.  **Prayer Record Screen**: The Record Button Issues and overall UI/logic problems on the prayer recording screen were tackled in .
    *   The screen content was wrapped in a  to enable scrollability and ensure all elements are visible.
    *   A  was integrated to display Quran search results dynamically.
    *   Language selection buttons (عربي, عربي + English, عربي + Español) were correctly repositioned to the right of the السورة كاملة button.
    *   Associated styles (e.g., , ) were updated to support the new layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.
3.  **Import Statement Fix**: An incorrect import for settings functions in  was corrected from  to .

During development, the AI encountered  issues preventing mobile preview. This was resolved by generating a production web build using  and serving it locally on . Screenshots confirmed the successful implementation of the fixes: prayer icons are visible, progress bars show dynamic colors, the record screen is scrollable, and the language buttons and search input are correctly positioned and functional. The overall layout and UX of the My Prayers and Record screens are significantly improved.
