<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and extensively developed the ALSABQON mobile application using Expo/React Native for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend. The work progressed systematically through several core features: implementing smooth animated week transitions, adding haptic feedback and a long-press quick action sheet to the  component, and managing its conditional visibility. A significant effort was dedicated to enhancing the My Prayers landing page with prayer icons, task progress bars, and improved prayer row navigation. The Tasks page received a complete overhaul, incorporating advanced features like grouping, swipe actions, and detailed progress indicators. The trajectory also highlights persistent debugging efforts, particularly around UI rendering and icon asset management, demonstrating a methodical problem-solving approach. The current state focuses on setting up the new Lessons page, interrupted by critical bug fixes for prayer icons and verse search.

<product_requirements>
The ALSABQON application is a cross-platform prayer tracker and Qur’an study tool, implemented with Expo/React Native and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Initial features include email/Facebook authentication, user profiles, and admin account deletion. The Home screen offers drawer navigation, a story feed, and interaction. The My Prayers module features a 7-day progress bar, an expandable Hijri/Gregorian calendar (color-coded by score), and a list of five prayers with a record button. The Record view allows Qur'an verse selection (full surah/range), searching, and answering four questions per rak'ah for scoring (12.5 pts each), which generate tasks.

Recent enhancements include:
- Smooth animated slide transitions for week navigation.
- Haptic feedback and a long-press quick action sheet on the 7-day .
- Hiding the 7-day week bar when the full month calendar is expanded, and showing it in week view.
- My Prayers landing page: Prayer icons before names, task progress bars (replacing R1/R2 badges), and updated record button behavior (checkmark/task icon if recorded, تسجيل if not). The entire prayer row is clickable to access the detailed prayer screen.
- A Daily Progress bar under the prayers list, showing overall daily completion.
- Tasks page: Prayer icons, visual hierarchy, progress indicators, empty state, grouping by date/prayer/type, swipe to complete/delete, categories/priorities, and overall completion overview.
- Lessons page: Main page with categories (Fiqh, Aqeedah, Tafseer), overall knowledge progress bar, expandable categories to list lessons. Lesson page displaying content (text/video), 1-5 star rating, views/ratings count, four engagement questions (Did you understand? Make dua? Practice? Share/teach?), each with a task icon. A progress bar for lesson completion and a comments section. This page will be a comprehensive Islamic Learning Management System.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo/React Native frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend.



**Key Files and Directories:**

-   : FastAPI backend application. Handles basic health checks and status logging to MongoDB.
-   : Defines main drawer navigation, enforces RTL, and applies global theme. It references  which is not yet created.
-   : The core My Prayers screen.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented conditional visibility of , enhanced prayer list rendering with icons, progress bars, and updated record button behavior. Made entire prayer rows clickable for navigation. Added a Daily Progress bar.
-   : The Tasks screen.
    -   **Changes:** Completely rebuilt to include prayer icons, overall and category-specific progress bars, an empty state, grouping by date/prayer/type, swipe-to-complete/delete actions, and priority categorization.
-   : Renders the 7-day week bar.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented smooth animated slide transitions using  v3, haptic feedback with , and a long-press quick action sheet (using  for iOS,  for Android) for navigation.
-    (NEW): A reusable component to render horizontal progress bars, used for prayer-specific tasks and daily progress.
-    (NEW): A custom hook responsible for loading prayer icons (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) as base64 strings for embedding.
    -   **Status:** Currently being debugged as some icon base64 data was missing.
-   : Defines data models for prayer records and task management. Task-related functions were read to understand task structure.
-    (NEW): Created to manage data structures for the upcoming Lessons page, including categories, lessons, and progress tracking.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of all prayer icons' base64 data into .
- Fix the issue where search for verses not showing up on the prayer record screen.
- Implement the comprehensive Lessons page based on the detailed requirements provided by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was interrupted while setting up the foundation for the new Lessons page. The plan was to build a comprehensive Islamic Learning Management System. The AI had just created  to define the necessary data structures for lessons, categories, and user progress.

However, the user paused this work to report two critical bugs: prayer icons were not displaying on the preview, and the verse search functionality was not working. The AI diagnosed the prayer icon issue to missing base64 data for some icons within the  hook. It re-downloaded the Asr icon's base64 and was in the process of acquiring and integrating the base64 for the Maghrib and Isha icons, leveraging the  to assist with these critical fixes before returning to the Lessons page development.

<optional_next_step>
Complete adding the missing base64 icon data to  and then fix the verse search functionality.
