The AI engineer successfully progressed through a complex series of feature enhancements and bug fixes for the ALSABQON mobile application. The trajectory started with a detailed overview of existing My Prayers and My Azkar requirements, alongside an initial set of pending tasks for these pages. A significant challenge involved debugging persistent frontend preview issues related to  and environment configuration, which was ultimately resolved with the 's help by fixing .

A major phase focused on the My Charities page, which was found to be entirely broken. The  was crucial in identifying numerous JavaScript syntax errors as the root cause, leading to its successful restoration. Subsequently, the My Charities page underwent a comprehensive redesign to align its layout and functionality with the My Azkar page, including new filter buttons and date range selection. This introduced further complex calendar and data display issues, particularly with date synchronization and range selection, which required multiple iterations of fixes.

The final, and most challenging, problem centered on persistent timestamp inaccuracies across both My Azkar and My Charities entries. The AI engineer first attempted to hardcode the Saudi Arabia timezone, then shifted to detecting the user's device timezone, implementing extensive backend and frontend changes for client-side timestamp generation. Despite these efforts, the user reported no changes, revealing the core issue lay in the *display logic* rather than storage. The AI engineer meticulously fixed the UI's  functions to correctly parse timezone-less timestamps and ensured the display fields matched the API response, finally resolving the critical timestamp display problem. This trajectory showcases a methodical approach to complex UI/UX, environment, and data handling issues.

<product_requirements>
The ALSABQON app, a prayer tracker and Qur’an tool, required extensive enhancements for its My Prayers, My Azkar, and My Charities features.
**My Prayers**:
- **Layout**: One-line, Right-to-Left (RTL) display: Prayer Logo → Name → Progress Chart → Task Icon (clipboard, gray/colored) → Record Button.
- **Navigation**: Direct calendar navigation to prayer list (no ملخص اليوم). تم button on prayer completion should navigate to the main prayers menu.
- **Rakka Comments**: Add comment boxes under each rakka's tasks.
- **Questions**: Specific Arabic questions, with only Question 4 (هل علمت الايات؟) showing a number field for Yes answers (remove لكم شخص). Remove الأسئلة header.
- **UI/UX**: Consistent safe area margins, Arabic prayer names, fixed Dhuhr icon, default to Rakka 1.
**My Azkar**:
- **Layout**: Separate area for chart, bottom margins.
- **Zikr Display**: Correct zikr names and icons on detail page, name in page header. Fix ذكر غير محدد errors.
- **Functionality**: Back button from Zikr detail page to Azkar main menu, auto-update zikr counts, correct calendar day numbers and shortened Arabic day names.
- **UI**: Highlight Today button with date, add أداءك خلال أسبوع/شهر text for filters. Chart bars must stay inside the box and not overlap content. Chart bars must vary in length based on daily achievement.
- **Calendar**: Address date mismatch (e.g., Tuesday 2 Sept displays 3 Sept), RTL/LTR alignment issues, and ensure daily progress is recorded under the correct day.
**My Charities**:
- **Restoration**: The page became empty and needed its previous data and functionality restored.
- **Redesign (to match My Azkar)**:
    - Place 'صدقاتي' (Arabic) at the top center, remove English text.
    - Position calendar logo next to 'صدقاتي' (right-aligned).
    - Remove language selection, display charity names only in Arabic.
    - Remove date line from the page.
    - Add four filter buttons: اختر (Select), شهر (Month), اسبوع (Week), and اليوم (Today), displaying charity entries accordingly.
    - Display current date/range under the buttons (today's date for اليوم, ranges for اسبوع, شهر, اختر).
    - اختر button must open a calendar to select a *range* of dates, not just a single day.
    - Ensure auto-refresh when user enters data.
    - After entering charity data, navigate to the main list of charities, not the app's main page.
- **Data Accuracy**: Fix date mismatches (e.g., selecting Thursday shows Wednesday's data), and inconsistencies between main page and detail page charity counts.
**Global Timestamping**:
- All entries (Azkar and Charities) must be recorded using the exact current local time from the user’s mobile device.
- The displayed time must match the device’s system clock, not a fixed or shifted server time.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was diligently working on the most persistent and critical issue reported by the user: incorrect timestamping of entries in both the My Azkar and My Charities sections. Despite multiple previous attempts to fix this, including implementing Saudi Arabia timezone and then shifting to device-local timezone detection with client-side timestamp generation, the user consistently reported that no visible changes occurred. Specifically, Azkar entries were still appearing as 3:00 AM, and Charity entries were off by approximately 3 hours (e.g., 10:10 PM local time showing as 7:10 PM).

The AI engineer's final investigation correctly pinpointed the problem to two core issues within the frontend's display logic:
1.  **Incorrect Field Usage in My Azkar**: In , the UI was erroneously attempting to display timestamps using  or , while the actual, correct timestamp information was consistently provided by the API in the  field.
2.  **Inconsistent Timezone Parsing**: For both Azkar and Charity pages, the  utility functions were receiving timestamp strings from the backend (e.g., ) that lacked explicit timezone indicators (like 'Z' for UTC or  for offsets). This ambiguity caused JavaScript's  constructor to interpret these strings inconsistently or as local time, leading to the observed 3-hour discrepancies when compared to the user's actual device clock.

To rectify these:
*   In , the code  was changed to  to ensure the correct data field was being utilized for display.
*   In both  and , the  functions were significantly enhanced. They now proactively check if a timestamp string includes timezone information; if not, they append 'Z' (assuming the backend stores these as UTC). Crucially, when formatting the  object, they now explicitly use  to ensure the displayed time is accurately converted and presented according to the user's *device's local timezone settings*. Error handling was also integrated to gracefully manage any malformed timestamp strings.

The frontend service was restarted, and after these comprehensive fixes, the AI engineer declared the timestamp display issues to be completely resolved, expecting all new entries to show timestamps that perfectly match the user's device clock.
