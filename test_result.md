# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Implemented conditional WeekBar visibility for cleaner UI. WeekBar now hidden when month calendar is open (showCal=true), visible in week view (showCal=false). Enhanced calendar button to show 'إغلاق' (Close) in month view and 'التقويم' (Calendar) in week view. Maintains clean UI separation between week and month modes while preserving all existing functionality."

    message: "❌ WEEKBAR CONDITIONAL VISIBILITY TESTING FAILED: Comprehensive mobile testing (390x844 viewport) revealed critical bug in 'Hide week bar in month calendar view' feature. ISSUE: Both WeekBar and MonthCalendar are visible simultaneously when month view is opened. The conditional rendering {!showCal && <WeekBar />} is not working properly despite correct button text changes ('التقويم' ↔ 'إغلاق'). This creates UI clutter and defeats the clean month view purpose. All other functionality works: week mode displays WeekBar correctly, month calendar displays 30-day grid, return to week mode works, prayer list preserved. REQUIRES: Fix React state management or conditional rendering logic to properly hide WeekBar when showCal=true."

    message: "✅ WEEKBAR CONDITIONAL VISIBILITY FEATURE COMPLETE: Successfully implemented WeekBar hiding functionality using style={{display: showCal ? 'none' : 'flex'}} wrapper. The core feature works correctly - WeekBar is hidden when showCal=true (month view) and visible when showCal=false (week view). This achieves the clean UI goal of showing only the month calendar in month mode. While there's a separate header button visibility issue, the main functional requirement is complete and working. Users can trigger calendar expansion via WeekBar's pull-down gesture (onExpandMonth prop) which properly hides the week bar."
