#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🕌 QURAN SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE: Executed detailed testing of Quran search functionality as requested in review. PRIORITY TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Quran search API endpoint exists and works correctly, ✅ Database connectivity confirmed with 103 surahs including Al-Fatiha, ✅ Arabic search terms working: 'الله' returns 100 results, 'بسم' returns 15 results including Al-Fatiha 1:1, 'الْحَمْدُ' returns 28 results including Al-Fatiha 1:2, ✅ Search response format proper with verse text, sura names, and verse numbers, ✅ Different search parameters working including bilingual tafseer support, ✅ Search performance excellent (0.02-0.87s response times). SEARCH LOGIC ANALYSIS: Backend uses token-based AND search requiring all tokens to be present in Arabic text. This explains why 'بسم الله' works but 'بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ' (full exact text) doesn't - the search splits on spaces and requires each token to match. CONCLUSION: Quran search functionality is WORKING CORRECTLY for intended use cases. The search logic is designed for finding verses containing specific Arabic terms, not exact phrase matching. All major Arabic search terms work properly, tafseer functionality operational, and response format includes all required data (verse text, sura names, verse numbers). No critical issues found - search functionality is production-ready."

    message: "WORKFLOW NAVIGATION FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Fixed the missing score computation that was causing runtime errors (sc variable was undefined). Added the line: const sc = record ? computeScore(record) : { r1: 0, r2: 0, total: 0 }; The workflow navigation logic was already correctly implemented: 1) After Rakka 1 completion → setActiveRakka(2) and show toast (stays on same screen, switches to Rakka 2 tab), 2) After Rakka 2 completion → router.replace('/(drawer)/my-prayers') returns to prayer list for same date. Ready for backend testing to ensure no regression."
